WHAT IS THE OMA SERIES:

Offworld Mercenary Arsenal (OMA) is a varied collection of weapons, items, devices, grenades, ammo and tools. In this pack they're provided as 2D pixel-art sprites. Use these assets in your commercial or personal projects - be it games, animations, illustrations, media or anything else.


==

QUICK START:

- If you just want 1:1 sprites for your 2D game, go to Sprites folder.

- If you want 2000% upscaled images for non-pixel perfect projects, go to Upscales folder.


==

PACKAGE CONTENTS - Folder Navigation:

# Sprites
- 2D side-view 1:1 sprites of each weapon, ready for use in pixel-perfect games. The pixel-art uses a '32 pixels per meter' measurement/size/scale standard. 

# Upscales
- The upscaled versions are easier to handle in non-pixel-perfect games. The "20X" are resized 20 times the original size and are standardized when viewed side by side.

LORE:

In a far spacefaring future there be humans, aliens, mercenaries, freelancers, contractors and adventurers that go to different places in the galaxy to blast away various monsters, robots and vehicles that threaten the peace of the galaxy.

OMA is a general umbrella term to describe the entire collective of various weapons, tools and devices that these people may use during their adventures - regardless of what origin or intended purpose the gun originally had. Usually someone got it somewhere, somehow, and decided to use it because they liked it or because it was the only thing available to them.

The lore and weapon descriptions are intentionally vague so that you can inject your own lore into these guns. I merely give a suggestion as to what each piece is and what use-case it could have, but you or your writer are encouraged to replace all that info with whatever weapon stats and description as you wish.


==

LICENCE:

Use the files freely in your commercial or personal projects as much as you want. 

Ideally do not repackage, redistribute, resell the assets or do NFTs with them. That would be uncool.

COMMISSION SERVICE FOR CUSTOM MADE WEAPONS:

Art Commissions OPEN!

I'm accepting art commissions for custom weapons in 3D & pixel-art!

I'm offering these commission types:
* 3D weapon model in pixel-art style (includes pixel-art sprites too!)
* Pixel-art 2D weapon sprite
* General 2D pixel-art game assets

I can turn your favorite weapon concept art images into pixel-art and 3D models!

You can use these in commercial games, animations, illustrations or prints - think coffee mug, sticker or t-shirt with your favorite cool weapon printed on it as realistically detailed hand-drawn pixel-art!

The commission platforms listed below makes commissions safe, clear and organized for both parties involved.

I offer 3 revisions per each art stage, so you can correct the final design as I make it for you.
